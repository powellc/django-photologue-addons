This project exists mostly to provide a way to have useful tools for photologue without cluttering the core repo, and also to allow these utilities to be used with any recent version of django-photologue.

Tags
--------

Currently the only thing in the project are two new tags:

* get_public_photos
* get_gallery

They allow you to embed photologue photos and galleries into whatever other pages on your site you'd like them to appear on, such as a flatpage.

Checkout the templatetags/photologue_extra_tags.py file for more information.
